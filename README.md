this project is on Web Application Manual Testing for an E-commerce Website.
I did this project to understand how testing actually works for real web applications like Amazon or Flipkart.

I made this project using Python on Programiz Online Compiler, but it’s not about coding — it’s more like showing how manual testing is done in a structured way.
Basically, I’ve written a test plan, a few test cases, and some sample bug reports — all printed through Python code.

So when I run the program, it prints the full project like a report — kind of like how we document test results in real companies

What I Did in the Project

First, I wrote a Test Plan that describes the objective, scope, and test environment.
For example, I mentioned that we’re testing features like login, add to cart, and checkout on a demo e-commerce website.

Then, I created sample test cases.
For example:

One test case checks if the login works with valid credentials.

Another checks if the Add to Cart button adds the product properly.

And one checks if the checkout process goes through successfully.

After that, I added a few bug reports — like cases where:

The “Add to Cart” button doesn’t work,

Or the “Login” page accepts invalid credentials.
For each bug, I mentioned severity, steps to reproduce, and expected vs actual results, just like we do in real bug reports
